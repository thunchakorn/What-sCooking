# WhatsCooking

This work is my Project in BADS7201-Machine Learning programming class of BADS program at NIDA.
I choose What's Cooking? dataset provide by Yummly on Kaggle as my dataset for my project.

here the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking

Note: Many of my codes both inspire and come from Notebooks and Discussion of kaggle of this dataset

What I've done to this data
1. Preporcessing and EDA
2. TF-IDF in order to explore each cuisine's ingredients identity score and cluster of cuisine
3. Word2Vec in order to explore which ingredients are mostly used together
4. Bring it all together to create new fusion dish

All code and result is in cooking.ipynb in this repository, and I also upload my presentation slide and report (written in Thai).


Hopes everyone enjoy and get something from my code, here are some of my visualization:
