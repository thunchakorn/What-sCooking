# What-sCooking

This is my work on What's Cooking? dataset provide by Yummly on Kaggle.
here the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking

What I've done to this data
1. Preporcessing and EDA
2. TF-IDF in order to explore each cuisine's ingredients identity score and cluster of cuisine
3. Word2Vec in order to explore which ingredients are mostly used together
4. Bring it all together to create new fusion dish
